# Analyze Your Application Size

ESP-IDF Extension provides powerful tools to analyze your application's memory usage, helping you optimize storage allocation. You can visualize size information in two convenient ways:

## Visual Analysis
Get a detailed graphical breakdown of your application's memory usage:

1. Run the command "ESP-IDF: Size Analysis of the Binaries"
2. Press Enter to see a visual representation of memory usage
